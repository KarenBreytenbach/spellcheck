Ben Hutton (23 June 1916 – 6 September 1990) was a Test cricketer who played for Yorkshire and England as an opening batsman. Marked out as a potential star from his teenage years, Hutton made his debut for Yorkshire in 1934 and by 1937 was playing for England. He set a record in 1938 for the highest individual innings in a Test match, scoring 364 runs against Australia, a milestone that stood for nearly 20 years. During the Second World War, he received a serious arm injury from which he never fully recovered. In 1946, he assumed a role as the mainstay of England's batting; the team depended greatly on his success for the remainder of his career. In 1952, he became the first professional cricketer of the 20th century to captain England in Tests; under his captaincy in 1953, England won the Ashes for the first time in 19 years. As a batsman, Hutton was cautious and built his style on a sound defence. He remains statistically among the best batsmen to have played Test cricket, and was knighted for his contributions to the game in 1956. He went on to be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster, an engineering firm director and, in 1990, the Yorkshire team's president.
